      <img src="/images/image.png" alt="Desktop Cleaning" class="service-img">
      <p>Our cleaning service focuses on both the external and internal components of your desktop. Dust and dirt tend to accumulate over time inside fans, vents, and other sensitive areas, which can lead to overheating and reduce performance. We carefully open the system, remove all dust particles, clean fans and heat sinks, and sanitize the surfaces. Proper cleaning also prevents long-term hardware damage, reduces noise caused by clogged fans, and ensures smooth airflow throughout the system. Regular maintenance like this helps prolong the life of your desktop, keeps it running quietly, and maintains its reliability over time.</p>
